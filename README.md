# Box-Shadow-Generator

Got it! Since your copy button currently copies only the shadow property values (not the full CSS box-shadow code), I can tweak the LinkedIn post wording to reflect that accurately:

ðŸš€ Just Launched: My Box Shadow Generator! ðŸŽ¨ðŸ’»

Iâ€™m excited to share my latest projectâ€”a Box Shadow Generator built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript! As Iâ€™m still learning JavaScript, this project was a great opportunity to practice and improve my skills. With some help and lots of learning, I successfully completed it!

âœ¨ What it does:
âœ… Easily customize box shadows with intuitive controls
âœ… Instantly preview changes in real-time
âœ… Copy the shadow property values with a single click

This project helped me understand JavaScript better, and Iâ€™d love to hear your thoughts on it! Check it out and let me know what you think. Feedback and suggestions are always welcome! ðŸ™Œ
